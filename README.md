OneNote Object Model (onom)
====

*This projet is a lab in [OneNoteLabs](https://github.com/idvorkin/OneNoteLabs/wiki)*

This project began life as an easy to use OneNoteObjectModel exposed via C#. It evolved to include rich capabilities and a touch friendly user interface to expose those capabilities.  When development has stabilized these items will be split up into different projects. 

Today this project contains the following directories, matching the functionality above. 

* OneNotePieMenu - A touch friendly menu exposing the many OneNote Capabilities
* OneNoteCapabilities - a collection of useful capabilities, including template pages, and smarttags. 
* OneNoteObjectModel - the OneNote object model itself. 
* Linqpad\Snippets - Snippets in Linqpad allowing for easy OneNote experimentation.

* People Pages - Organize your interactions via people pages, with pages per day you meet a person, and personal agenda.
* Topic Pages - A least recently used
* Augmentation - Augment data in OneNote. This is primarily used for smartTags.

LinqPad Snippets:

Experimental functionality is developed and exposed in [linqpad]((ig2600.blogspot.com/2012/12/cool-toolslinqpad.html). This is a great way to try out the experimental features, and contribute to them if you desire.
