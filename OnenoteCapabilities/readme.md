Onenote Capabilities
====

A collection of capabilities beyond the onenote object model.  Most capabilities are exposed via OneNote Menu.

Daily Pages
----
I keep a page per day in onenote. I also keep weekly summaries. Daily pages handles creating the pages from templates, and provides helpful functions to navigate to those pages. 

Erase Empty 
---
It's easy to accidentally create sections and pages in one note. Erase Empty will find and erase those empty items that have not been modified. 

Settings
----
  Today, settings are hard coded in settings.cs. Either use the hard coded settings or update the library to read settings from a file for all of the users.
